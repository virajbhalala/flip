<b> Flip </b>

I was doing this project when I was learning Objective-C during summer 2014. The project is based on Matchismo from
Stanford University iOS development tutorial. However, this project is unfinished (for now) because in the middle of doing
this project and learning Objective-C Apple released Swift language which pulled my attention to it. In futute, I will
share my projects as well as practice projects in my Github account.
